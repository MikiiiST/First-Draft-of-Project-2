# First-Draft-of-Project-2
This is my first draft for project 2. The draft performs multiple sequence alignment and pairwise sequence alignment for sequences of human p53, chimpanzee p53, dogs p53, and elephants p53. Lastly, the draft constructs a histogram showing percent similarities between chimpanzee, dogs, and elephants' p53 sequences with respect to human p53.
